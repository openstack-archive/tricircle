    Note for Networking

    * Only Local Network and VLAN network supported.
      Local Network means the network will only present in one region,
      it could be VxLAN or VLAN network.
      VLAN is the only L2 network type which supports cross
      Neutron L2 networking and the bridge network for L3 networking.
    * Pagination and sort are not supported at the same time for list
      operation.
    * For security group rule, remote group not supported yet. Use IP
      prefix to create security group rule.
    * Need to specify the region name as the availability zone hint for
      external network creation, that means the external network will
      be located in the specified region.
